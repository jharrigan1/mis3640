<h1>The Next Google</h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>The aim of this project is to create a platform that evolves with the current technology today as it is continually evolving. 
By creating a system we are able to see various products from certain stores such as Amazon and compare these prices to other stores in order for a customer to get the best deal.
The intention of this project is to cross refrence different companies pricing on products on sale at big box retaillers and see how they differ from online retaillers.</p>

<h2>README</h2>
<p>Need instructional text here on how to run the system.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The system works when the user manually inputs a certain product. The system will then cross reference this price with the amazon price and we will be able to determine which one is cheaper.</p>
